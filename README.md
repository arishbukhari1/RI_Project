# Methodology 

To predict immunization coverage and identify gaps in the African region, the following steps will be taken: 

# Data Preprocessing: 

- Handle missing values, particularly in under-reported regions. 
- Normalize and standardize numerical variables. 
- Merge immunization data with demographic and geospatial datasets. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 

- Identify trends and patterns in immunization coverage across countries and years. 
- Visualize geographic distribution of coverage rates using heatmaps and choropleth maps. 
- Analyze correlations between socio-demographic variables and vaccination rates. 

# Feature Engineering and Selection: 

- Develop composite indices for healthcare accessibility and socio-economic status. 
- Use feature importance techniques (Random Forest feature importance) to identify key predictors of low coverage. 

# Predictive Modeling: 

- Classification Models: To predict whether a population subgroup achieves target vaccination rates (for example â‰¥90% coverage). 
- Regression Models: To predict continuous variables such as dropout rates or coverage percentages. 
- Time-Series Models: To forecast future coverage trends in specific regions. 

# Model Evaluation: 

- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. 
- Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness across different datasets. 

# Geospatial Analysis: 

Integrate GIS data to create maps highlighting high-risk areas with low coverage and poor healthcare access. 

 
# Expected Output 

The project will deliver the following outputs: 

- Insights into Immunization Coverage: Identification of regions with low coverage rates and high dropout rates, along with the primary factors influencing these trends. 
- Predictive Models: Accurate models to forecast future immunization coverage and identify at-risk populations. 
- Geospatial Visualizations: Dynamic maps to visualize current and forecasted immunization gaps, enabling targeted interventions.
